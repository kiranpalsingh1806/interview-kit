Sharding is a very important concept that helps the system to keep data in different resources according to the sharding process. The word “Shard” means “a small part of a whole“. Hence Sharding means dividing a larger part into smaller parts.   
In DBMS, Sharding is a type of DataBase partitioning in which a large database is divided or partitioned into smaller data and different nodes. These shards are not only smaller, but also faster and hence easily manageable.

Kernel is central component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. It basically manages operations of memory and CPU time. It is core component of an operating system. Kernel acts as a bridge between applications and data processing performed at hardware level using inter-process communication and system calls.
